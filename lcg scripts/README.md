-true_rng.html

This file stands for "true random number generator" and it generates numbers (when you click a button).
The script in the html file takes the id ("id" is a flick api feature) of a photo that was recently uploaded on flickr.com and 
multiplies it by latitude of the international space station at that given time. From this large number, the 3rd until the 7th digit are taken to give the random number. This is also explained in the comments of the script.

(you will have to allow chrome or your browser to load some unsafe scripts so that the generator works. They arent viruses it is just that the APIs that I used for the generator still use "http" instead of "https". Nothing I can do about that)
