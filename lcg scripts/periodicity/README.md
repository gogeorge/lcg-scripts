- ```periodicity_of_the_lcg.js```

This script finds the period length of a LCG. More details can be found as comments in the file 

- ```period_visualization.html```

This script generates an image of the lcg. If there is a pattern in the image then the period length is short and the lcg is not effective
(I am not using this script anymore)
- ```lcg_visualization.png```	

The image that was generated from ```period_visualization.html``` script
